CampusConnectPlus
This is a native Android application built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It's designed to connect students and administrators within a campus community.

**What I Created**
•Modern UI: The application uses Jetpack Compose for its user interface, following modern Android development practices.
•Local Data Storage: It uses Room persistence library to store data locally on the device, ensuring offline access to information.
•Modular Architecture: The codebase is organized into modules (core, data, feature_admin, feature_student), which promotes separation of concerns and maintainability.
•Distinct User Roles: The app caters to two different user types:
•Students: Can likely view campus-related information.
•Administrators: Have separate features, probably for managing the content students see.

**What I Finished**
•A solid foundation for a campus-focused application.
•Clear separation between data, UI, and feature-specific logic.
•A database schema for storing application data.
•A multi-user system with distinct experiences for students and administrators.

**Recommendations for Future Development**
•Backend Integration: Implement a backend service (e.g., using Firebase or a custom REST API) to synchronize data between users and provide real-time updates.
•Authentication: Add a robust authentication system to securely manage user accounts.
•Feature Expansion:
•For Students: Consider adding features like event registration, course schedules, or a campus map.
•For Admins: Enhance the content management system. For example, allow admins to send push notifications for important announcements.
•Testing: Write unit and integration tests to ensure the application is robust and reliable.
•UI/UX Refinements: Conduct user testing to gather feedback and further improve the user experience.
